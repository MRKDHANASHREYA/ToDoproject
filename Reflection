Today I learnt about front-end and back-end program 
In this I learnt the process of a application 
I came to know about new terms like Middleware controller
Second topic I learnt about was how to crate a GitHub profile and how to use GitHub to explore the code
We created our project and created a file to give reflection 
Thank you
